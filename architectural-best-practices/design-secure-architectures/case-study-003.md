> An online gaming company wants to block access to its application from specific countries; however, the company wants to allow its remote development team (from one of the blocked countries) to have access to the application. The application is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances running under an Application Load Balancer with AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF).

- To block access to the application from specific countries while allowing access from a specific remote development team (which is located in one of the blocked countries), you can implement a **Geo-blocking solution** with **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) combined with **IP whitelisting**. AWS WAF allows you to define custom rules to control which countries can access your application, and you can override these rules for your remote development team.

    ### **Solution Overview:**

    1. **Geo-Blocking with AWS WAF**: You can use AWS WAF to block requests based on the **GeoIP** location of the incoming traffic, which allows you to block or allow traffic based on the **source country**.
    2. **IP Whitelisting**: To allow access from the remote development team, you can whitelist their **IP addresses** or **IP ranges** so that they can bypass the Geo-blocking rule.

    ### **Step-by-Step Approach:**

    ### **1. Set Up Geo-Blocking with AWS WAF**:

    AWS WAF supports **Geo-blocking**, which allows you to block or allow traffic based on the origin country of the request. You can create a rule to block traffic from specific countries while allowing access from others.

    - **Steps**:
        1. In the **AWS WAF Console**, create a new **Web ACL** for your Application Load Balancer (ALB).
        2. Under **Rules**, add a **Geo Match Rule**:
            - In the rule, select the countries you want to block.
            - AWS WAF will block traffic from the selected countries automatically.
        3. Set the **default action** of the Web ACL to **allow**. The idea is to block countries and then add an exception for your development team.
    - **Example**:
        - If you want to block traffic from countries like **Country A**, **Country B**, and **Country C**, you can use the GeoMatch condition to select these countries and block their requests.

    ### **2. Whitelist IP Addresses of the Remote Development Team**:

    To ensure that your remote development team (which is located in one of the blocked countries) can still access the application, you can **whitelist their IP addresses**.

    - **Steps**:
        1. In the **AWS WAF Console**, create a **Custom Rule** to allow traffic from your development team's IP addresses.
        2. Add a condition in the custom rule to **allow** requests from specific IP addresses or IP address ranges. If your development team uses dynamic IPs, you can request them to provide a list of their current public IP addresses or use a range if available.
        3. Prioritize the **allow** rule in the WAF rule set to ensure that the remote development team’s traffic is allowed before the Geo-blocking rule is applied.
    - **Example**:
        - Suppose your remote development team’s IP address range is `192.168.1.0/24`. You would configure a WAF rule that allows all traffic from that IP range, regardless of the country of origin.

    ### **3. Apply the Web ACL to the ALB**:

    Once the rules are configured, apply the **Web ACL** to the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** that fronts your EC2 instances. This will ensure that the WAF rules are applied to all incoming traffic to your application.

    - **Steps**:
        1. Go to the **AWS WAF Console**.
        2. Attach the **Web ACL** to your **Application Load Balancer** under the **AWS WAF** settings.
        3. Verify that the WAF is working as expected by testing traffic from both blocked countries (to confirm they are being blocked) and your development team's IP range (to confirm they can still access the application).

    ### **4. Testing**:

    - **Test Access**: Test the application from a **blocked country** to verify that the traffic is indeed blocked.
    - **Test Whitelisting**: Test the application from an IP address in the remote development team's range to ensure they can bypass the Geo-blocking and access the application.

    ### **Diagram of the Solution**:

    - **Users** → **Application Load Balancer** → **AWS WAF**
        - **AWS WAF** will inspect the incoming request’s **GeoIP** and match against the blocklist.
        - If the request is from a blocked country, it will be denied unless the request comes from a whitelisted IP address (the development team).
        - If the request is from the whitelisted IP range, the request is allowed.

    ### **Benefits of This Approach**:

    - **Cost-Effective**: AWS WAF is highly cost-effective for managing and controlling web traffic based on geographic locations.
    - **Granular Control**: You can precisely control access to your application based on both **geo-location** and **IP addresses**.
    - **Scalability**: This solution works at scale and doesn't require additional infrastructure for security.
    - **Ease of Management**: IP whitelisting and geo-blocking rules can be easily updated and managed through the AWS WAF console.

    ### **Conclusion**:

    To block access to your application from specific countries while allowing access from your remote development team, use **AWS WAF** for **Geo-blocking** and combine it with **IP whitelisting** for the development team's IP addresses. This approach is **cost-optimal**, **resource-efficient**, and provides **granular control** over the traffic to your application.
