A company's cloud architect has set up a solution that uses Amazon Route 53 to configure the DNS records for the primary website with the domain pointing to the Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company wants a solution where users will be directed to a static error page, configured as a backup, in case of unavailability of the primary website.

- Solution
    
    To achieve the solution where users are directed to a static error page in case the primary website is unavailable, you can implement **Route 53 health checks** combined with **failover routing**. This way, if the primary website becomes unavailable, Route 53 will automatically route traffic to the backup (static error page) hosted on Amazon S3.
    
    Here is a step-by-step solution:
    
    ### **Solution Overview**
    
    1. **Primary Website**: The primary website is hosted behind the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
    2. **Backup Error Page**: The static error page is hosted in an **Amazon S3 bucket** configured to serve a static HTML error page.
    3. **Route 53 Failover Routing**: You’ll use **Route 53's failover routing policy** to direct traffic to the primary website (via the ALB) and, in case of failure, redirect traffic to the static error page stored in S3.
    
    ### **Steps to Implement the Solution:**
    
    ### **1. Set Up the S3 Bucket for the Error Page**
    
    - Create an **S3 bucket** to host the static error page.
    - Upload your **error page** (e.g., `error.html`) to the bucket.
    - Configure the bucket for **static website hosting**.
        - In the S3 console, enable **Static website hosting** and specify the **index document** as `error.html`.
    
    ### **2. Configure Health Checks for Primary Website**
    
    - In **Amazon Route 53**, configure a **health check** that monitors the **Application Load Balancer** (ALB) associated with your primary website.
    - Route 53 will periodically check the health of the ALB using HTTP or HTTPS health checks.
        - The health check should be configured to check a URL path that confirms the site is up, such as `/healthcheck`.
    - If the health check fails (meaning the primary website is unavailable), Route 53 will route traffic to the backup error page.
    
    ### **3. Set Up Failover Routing in Route 53**
    
    - Create two **DNS records** in Route 53 for the domain:
        1. **Primary Record (ALB)**:
            - Use **Route 53's failover routing policy** to create a primary record that points to the **ALB** for the primary website.
            - Set the **health check** for this record to the health check you created for the ALB.
        2. **Secondary Record (S3 Error Page)**:
            - Create a secondary DNS record that points to the **S3 bucket** URL for the error page.
            - This will be a **failover** record, meaning it will only be used if the primary record (ALB) fails the health check.
    
    ### **4. Route 53 Record Configuration Example**
    
    Here’s how the Route 53 records might look:
    
    - **Primary Record (for ALB)**:
        - **Type**: A or CNAME (depending on your setup)
        - **Name**: `www.mywebsite.com`
        - **Routing Policy**: **Failover**
        - **Value**: The **DNS name of the ALB**.
        - **Health Check**: The health check associated with the ALB.
        - **Failover**: **Primary**
    - **Secondary Record (for S3 Error Page)**:
        - **Type**: A or CNAME (depending on your setup)
        - **Name**: `www.mywebsite.com`
        - **Routing Policy**: **Failover**
        - **Value**: The **S3 bucket endpoint** URL (e.g., `myerrorpage.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`).
        - **Failover**: **Secondary**
    
    ### **5. Testing**
    
    - Test the failover by simulating downtime on the primary website (e.g., disable the ALB or make it unreachable).
    - Ensure that when the primary site is down, users are automatically directed to the static error page hosted on S3.
    
    ### **Advantages of This Solution:**
    
    - **High Availability**: Route 53’s health checks and failover routing ensure that traffic is directed to a backup in case of failure, minimizing downtime.
    - **Low Maintenance**: The solution is fully automated with minimal manual intervention. Route 53 continuously monitors the health of the primary site and switches to the backup automatically when needed.
    - **Cost-Effective**: S3 hosting for the static error page is low-cost and highly reliable.
    
    ### **Conclusion**
    
    By combining **Route 53 health checks**, **failover routing**, and **S3 static website hosting**, you can achieve a highly available solution where users are automatically redirected to a static error page if the primary website becomes unavailable. This solution ensures a seamless user experience even during unexpected downtime.
