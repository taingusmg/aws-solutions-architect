> A company wants to store business-critical data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes which provide persistent storage independent of Amazon EC2 instances. During a test run, the development team found that on terminating an Amazon EC2 instance, the attached Amazon EBS volume was also lost, which was contrary to their assumptions.

- When you **terminate** an **Amazon EC2 instance**, **attached Amazon EBS volumes** are **lost** by default, but this behavior can be controlled through the **delete-on-termination** setting for **EBS volumes**.

    By default, when you launch an EC2 instance, the root EBS volume (the volume that contains the operating system) is marked for **deletion upon instance termination**. However, data stored on additional EBS volumes is **not automatically deleted** unless specified.

    ### **To address this issue**, you can do the following:

    ### **1. Check and Modify the Delete-On-Termination Setting for EBS Volumes**

    When you attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance, you can specify whether the volume should be deleted when the instance is terminated.

    - **For the Root EBS Volume** (the volume containing the OS):
        - By default, the root volume is set to delete upon termination.
        - You can change this behavior if you want the root volume to persist after instance termination.
    - **For Additional EBS Volumes** (non-root volumes):
        - When attaching an additional volume, ensure that the **delete-on-termination** attribute is **disabled** if you want the volume to persist after the instance is terminated.

    ### **How to Modify the Delete-On-Termination Setting:**

    1. **Check the Current Setting**:
        - You can check whether the **delete-on-termination** setting is enabled by viewing the EC2 instanceâ€™s block device mappings in the AWS Management Console.
    2. **Modify the Delete-On-Termination Attribute**:
        - You can modify the **delete-on-termination** setting for any attached EBS volume:
            - **AWS Console**: Go to **Volumes** in the EC2 Dashboard, select the volume, and modify the "Delete on Termination" setting.
            - **AWS CLI**: Use the `modify-volume-attachment` command to change the setting for a specific volume.
                
                ```bash
                bash
                Copy code
                aws ec2 modify-volume-attachment --volume-id vol-xxxxxxxx --instance-id i-xxxxxxxx --delete-on-termination false
                
                ```
                
    3. **When Launching EC2 Instance**:
        - You can specify the **delete-on-termination** behavior when launching an EC2 instance. In the **block device mapping** section, set the **delete-on-termination** option to `false` for the EBS volume you want to persist after termination.

    ### **2. Backup Strategy for Critical Data**

    To ensure that critical business data is protected, implement a backup strategy for your EBS volumes. This includes:

    - **EBS Snapshots**: Create regular snapshots of your critical data stored on EBS volumes. EBS snapshots are incremental, meaning they only store changes made since the last snapshot, saving both time and storage costs.
        - You can create snapshots manually or automate the process using **AWS Data Lifecycle Manager**.
    - **Automated Backups with AWS Backup**: Use **AWS Backup** to automate backup and retention for your Amazon EBS volumes. It allows you to create scheduled backups and restore them easily if necessary.

    ### **3. Implement EBS Volume Persistence**

    If you want to ensure that EBS volumes persist independently of EC2 instance lifecycles:

    - **Attach Volumes to New Instances**: After terminating an EC2 instance, the volume can be detached and attached to another EC2 instance. This allows you to retain the volume's data even after instance termination.
    - **Use Amazon EBS in Combination with EC2 Auto Scaling**: When implementing Auto Scaling, ensure the **delete-on-termination** option is disabled for EBS volumes if you want them to persist across instance launches and terminations.

    ### **Conclusion**:

    The default behavior of EBS volumes being deleted upon EC2 instance termination can be modified by disabling the **delete-on-termination** option for the EBS volumes. You should update this setting for both root and additional EBS volumes based on your data retention needs. Additionally, implementing a solid backup strategy using EBS snapshots or AWS Backup is essential for ensuring the availability and durability of your critical business data.
