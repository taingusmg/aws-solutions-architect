> A financial services company runs its flagship web application on AWS. The application serves thousands of users during peak hours. The company needs a scalable near-real-time solution to share hundreds of thousands of financial transactions with multiple internal applications. The solution should also remove sensitive details from the transactions before storing the cleansed transactions in a document database for low-latency retrieval.

- To meet the company's requirement for a **scalable near-real-time solution** to share **financial transactions**, cleanse sensitive details, and store the cleansed transactions in a **document database for low-latency retrieval**, a suitable solution would involve a combination of **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon Kinesis**, and **Amazon DynamoDB** or **Amazon DocumentDB**.

    ### **Recommended Solution Overview**:

    - **Ingestion and Stream Processing**: Use **Amazon Kinesis** to handle the real-time ingestion and processing of the financial transactions.
    - **Data Cleansing**: Use **AWS Lambda** to cleanse sensitive data from the transactions in real-time as they pass through the stream.
    - **Data Storage**: Use **Amazon DynamoDB** or **Amazon DocumentDB** to store the cleansed transactions for low-latency retrieval.

    ### **Step-by-Step Architecture**:

    ### **1. Real-Time Transaction Streaming with Amazon Kinesis**

    - **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** will be used to handle the near-real-time ingestion of financial transaction data.
        - Financial transactions are sent to the **Kinesis stream** where each transaction is represented as an event.
        - **Kinesis** provides the necessary scalability to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for high-volume data ingestion.
        
        **Steps**:
        
        - Set up a **Kinesis Data Stream** to capture the incoming transaction data.
        - Ensure that the stream can scale automatically based on the number of incoming records using **Kinesis Shards** to manage throughput.

    ### **2. Real-Time Data Processing with AWS Lambda**

    - **AWS Lambda** will process the streaming data in real-time. Lambda functions can be triggered by **Kinesis Streams**, which will allow you to process each transaction as it is ingested.**Steps**:**Example Lambda Logic**:
        - **Sensitive data cleansing**: The Lambda function will clean the financial transactions by removing or anonymizing sensitive details (e.g., customer names, account numbers, etc.).
        - For cleansing, you can use regular expressions, tokenization, or external services such as **AWS Macie** (if necessary for PII detection) or implement custom logic to remove sensitive data before passing it to the next stage.
        - Create an **AWS Lambda function** that processes records from the Kinesis stream.
        - The function should remove sensitive information, such as account details or transaction metadata.
        - Optionally, you can perform additional checks or transformations (e.g., formatting) if required for the internal applications.

    ### **3. Store Cleansed Data in a Document Database**

    - After the Lambda function processes and cleanses the financial transaction data, you need to store it in a document database for low-latency retrieval by internal applications.
        - **Amazon DynamoDB**: A **NoSQL database** that supports fast read and write operations, perfect for storing transaction data that needs to be accessed with low latency.
        - **Amazon DocumentDB**: A document database service that is fully compatible with MongoDB and can store JSON-like documents. This is useful if your application uses MongoDB-style queries.
        
        **Steps**:
        
        - **For DynamoDB**:
            - Create a **DynamoDB table** with a suitable partition key (e.g., `transaction_id`) and optionally a sort key.
            - Store cleansed transaction data in the DynamoDB table for fast and scalable access by internal applications.
        - **For DocumentDB**:
            - Create a **DocumentDB cluster**.
            - Store cleansed data as documents in collections for low-latency queries.
        
        **Example DynamoDB Integration**:

    ### **4. Monitoring, Scaling, and Error Handling**

    - **Monitoring with CloudWatch**:
        - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor the health of the **Kinesis Stream**, **Lambda function**, and the **database**. Set up CloudWatch metrics to track throughput, error rates, and resource utilization.
        - Configure **CloudWatch Alarms** to alert the engineering team if thresholds for data processing or system health are exceeded (e.g., if the Lambda function fails to process data or if DynamoDB read/write capacity is exceeded).
    - **Auto-scaling**:
        - For **Kinesis**, you can adjust the **shard count** based on the throughput requirements. DynamoDB also supports **auto-scaling** for handling traffic spikes.
    - **Error Handling in Lambda**:
        - Implement **retry logic** in the Lambda function to handle transient issues.
        - If Lambda fails to process data, you can store failed records in **Amazon SQS** or **Amazon SNS** for further investigation or reprocessing.

    ### **5. Optimizing Cost**

    - **DynamoDB**: Use **DynamoDB On-Demand** pricing if the traffic is unpredictable or **Provisioned** with auto-scaling if traffic patterns are more predictable.
    - **Kinesis**: Use **Kinesis Data Streams** with **auto-scaling** to adjust the shard count based on throughput demand. Use **Kinesis Data Firehose** if you need to ingest and store data directly into **S3** or other destinations for long-term storage and cost optimization.

    ### **Solution Summary:**

    1. **Amazon Kinesis**: Ingests and streams financial transaction data in real-time.
    2. **AWS Lambda**: Cleanses sensitive data from the transactions as they stream in.
    3. **Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon DocumentDB**: Stores cleansed data in a document database for fast and efficient retrieval by internal applications.
    4. **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors the system for performance, failures, and errors.
    5. **Cost Optimization**: Use the appropriate pricing models for Kinesis and DynamoDB to minimize costs based on usage patterns.

    ### **Conclusion:**

    This solution ensures a **scalable, near-real-time processing** pipeline for financial transactions, automatically cleansing sensitive details, and storing the cleansed data in a document database for low-latency access. It minimizes IT overhead, is highly scalable, and leverages AWS services that automatically scale to meet growing data demands.
