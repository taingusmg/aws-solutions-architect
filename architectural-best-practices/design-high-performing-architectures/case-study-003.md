> An IT company has built a custom data warehousing solution for a retail organization by using Amazon Redshift. As part of the cost optimizations, the company wants to move any historical data (any data older than a year) into Amazon S3, as the daily analytical reports consume data for just the last one year. However the analysts want to retain the ability to cross-reference this historical data along with the daily reports. The company wants to develop a solution with the LEAST amount of effort and MINIMUM cost. Which options to facilitate this use-case?

- To meet the requirements of **moving historical data to Amazon S3** while still retaining the ability to **cross-reference it with daily reports in Amazon Redshift** at minimal cost and effort, the most efficient solution is to **use Amazon Redshift Spectrum** in combination with **Amazon S3**.

    ### **Solution Overview:**

    1. **Move Historical Data to Amazon S3**:
        - You can **archive historical data (older than a year)** to **Amazon S3** by exporting it from Redshift. Amazon S3 offers highly durable and cost-effective storage for large datasets.
    2. **Use Amazon Redshift Spectrum to Query Data in S3**:
        - **Amazon Redshift Spectrum** enables you to **query data stored in S3** directly from your Amazon Redshift cluster, without needing to load it into Redshift. This allows you to join and cross-reference your historical data in S3 with the data currently in Amazon Redshift.
    3. **Cost and Effort Optimization**:
        - **Cost**: Storing data in **S3** is significantly cheaper than keeping all data in **Redshift**. Using **Redshift Spectrum** allows you to query data in S3 without needing to load it into Redshift, which also minimizes storage costs.
        - **Effort**: With **Redshift Spectrum**, you can easily create external tables that point to the S3 data and use SQL to query the data seamlessly alongside the data that remains in Redshift.

    ### **Steps to Implement the Solution**:

    ### **1. Archive Historical Data to S3**:

    - Export the historical data (older than a year) from **Amazon Redshift** to **Amazon S3**. This can be done using the `UNLOAD` command in Redshift:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        Copy code
        UNLOAD ('SELECT * FROM historical_data_table WHERE date_column < DATEADD(year, -1, CURRENT_DATE)')
        TO 's3://your-bucket/historical_data/'
        CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id=<access-key>;aws_secret_access_key=<secret-key>'
        DELIMITER ','
        ADDQUOTES
        ALLOWOVERWRITE;
        
        ```
        
    - Store the historical data in **Parquet** or **ORC** format for optimized performance when querying with **Redshift Spectrum**.

    ### **2. Set Up External Tables in Redshift Spectrum**:

    - Once the historical data is moved to S3, you can set up **external tables** in Amazon Redshift to reference that data. This can be done by creating a schema for your external tables:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        Copy code
        CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA spectrum_schema
        FROM DATA CATALOG
        DATABASE 'spectrum_database'
        IAM_ROLE 'arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:role/your-role';
        
        ```
        
    - Create external tables in Redshift that point to the historical data stored in S3:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        Copy code
        CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE spectrum_schema.historical_data (
        column1 datatype,
        column2 datatype,
        ...
        )
        STORED AS PARQUET
        LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/historical_data/';
        
        ```
        

    ### **3. Query Data Using Redshift Spectrum**:

    - You can now run SQL queries that combine the **current data** in your Amazon Redshift cluster with the **historical data** in S3 via Redshift Spectrum:
        
        ```sql
        sql
        Copy code
        SELECT current_data.column1, historical_data.column2
        FROM current_data_table AS current_data
        JOIN spectrum_schema.historical_data AS historical_data
        ON current_data.id = historical_data.id
        WHERE current_data.date >= DATEADD(year, -1, CURRENT_DATE);
        
        ```
        

    ### **4. Monitor and Optimize**:

    - Ensure that you are using efficient **file formats** (e.g., **Parquet** or **ORC**) in S3 to optimize Redshift Spectrum performance and reduce query costs.
    - Use **Amazon S3 Lifecycle Policies** to automatically archive or delete older data, ensuring that only relevant historical data is kept in S3.

    ### **Benefits of This Approach**:

    1. **Cost-Effective**: Storing data in **Amazon S3** is much cheaper than keeping large amounts of historical data in **Amazon Redshift**. You only pay for the data you query with **Redshift Spectrum**, and the cost of querying S3 is based on the amount of data scanned.
    2. **Seamless Integration**: **Amazon Redshift Spectrum** integrates seamlessly with your existing Redshift setup, so you donâ€™t need to redesign your analytics pipeline. You can query data in S3 just as you would with data in Redshift.
    3. **Minimal Effort**: The effort required to implement this solution is minimal compared to other approaches (like fully migrating data back into Redshift). You can query S3 data with minimal configuration and no data migration back into Redshift.
    4. **Scalability**: **Amazon S3** is highly scalable, and you can store petabytes of data at low cost. Redshift Spectrum can scale the queries to large datasets in S3, ensuring your solution grows with the business.

    ### **Conclusion**:

    Using **Amazon Redshift Spectrum** combined with **Amazon S3** for storing historical data is the **most cost-optimal** and **resource-efficient** solution. It allows the company to continue using their **Redshift data warehouse** for daily reports while minimizing storage costs by offloading historical data to **S3**. The ability to query and cross-reference historical and current data with minimal development effort meets both the performance and cost optimization requirements.
