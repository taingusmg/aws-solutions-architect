> An application with global users across AWS Regions had suffered an issue when the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) in a Region malfunctioned thereby taking down the traffic with it. The manual intervention cost the company significant time and resulted in major revenue loss. What solutions to reduce internet latency and add automatic failover across AWS Regions?

- To reduce internet latency and add **automatic failover** across AWS regions, you can implement a solution that ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency for your application globally. The combination of **Amazon Route 53** with **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**, **AWS Global Accelerator**, and **Cross-Region ELB** can be used to build a more resilient, low-latency, and fault-tolerant system. Here's a solution outline:

    ### **Solution Overview:**

    1. **Route 53 with Latency-Based Routing and Failover**:
        - **Amazon Route 53** is a scalable DNS service that can help direct users to the nearest AWS region with minimal latency. It can also be used for **automatic failover** if one region or ELB becomes unavailable.
        - You can configure **latency-based routing** to direct users to the ELB in the region with the lowest latency, improving performance. If a region fails or an ELB goes down, Route 53 can automatically route traffic to a healthy region.
    2. **AWS Global Accelerator**:
        - **AWS Global Accelerator** improves global application performance by routing traffic through **AWS's global network** rather than the public internet, reducing latency and increasing reliability.
        - It provides **automatic failover** and **health checks**, ensuring traffic is directed to the closest and healthiest region automatically.
    3. **Cross-Region Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:
        - Set up **Elastic Load Balancers** in multiple AWS regions to distribute traffic across regions.
        - **Cross-Region Load Balancing** ensures that traffic can be routed to the appropriate ELB in a different region if the primary ELB fails.

    ### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

    ### **1. Set Up Elastic Load Balancers in Multiple Regions**

    - Deploy **ELB** in **multiple AWS regions** to handle traffic across global users. Each region will have its own ELB that distributes traffic to application instances.
    - Ensure that your application is **stateless** so that it can scale across regions without session persistence issues.

    ### **2. Implement Amazon Route 53 with Latency-Based Routing**

    - **Create Health Checks**: Set up health checks for the **Elastic Load Balancers** in all regions to ensure that Route 53 can determine if an ELB is healthy or not.
    - **Latency-Based Routing**: Configure **Route 53 latency-based routing** so that users are directed to the region with the lowest latency. This helps improve performance by reducing the time it takes to reach the application.
    - **Failover Routing**: Set up **failover routing** in Route 53 so that if one ELB or region becomes unhealthy (due to malfunction or failure), traffic is automatically routed to the secondary region with a healthy ELB.

    **Steps**:

    - Create an **A record** in Route 53 for your application.
    - Set up routing rules to route traffic based on latency.
    - Configure **failover routing** to automatically redirect traffic to a healthy region if one ELB fails.

    ### **3. Configure AWS Global Accelerator**

    - **Create Global Accelerator**: Use **AWS Global Accelerator** to route user traffic through AWS's **global network** for lower latency, better reliability, and automatic failover across regions.
    - **Health Checks and Failover**: Global Accelerator monitors the health of your **global endpoints** (the ELBs in each region) and automatically redirects traffic to a healthy endpoint in another region in case of failure.
    - **Performance Improvement**: Traffic is routed over AWS's private network, which reduces **internet latency** and increases reliability.

    **Steps**:

    - Create a **Global Accelerator** and associate your application’s regions with it.
    - Set up **global endpoints** for each of your ELBs.
    - Configure **health checks** to automatically switch traffic in case of failures.

    ### **4. Enable Cross-Region Load Balancing**

    - Set up **cross-region load balancing** by configuring your ELBs to handle traffic from different regions. Ensure that **Route 53** and **Global Accelerator** are used to route traffic to the closest and healthiest ELB.
    - If one region's ELB fails, traffic is automatically routed to a different region with a healthy ELB, providing failover functionality.

    ### **5. Monitoring and Alerting**

    - **CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms**: Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor the performance and health of your **Elastic Load Balancers** and **Global Accelerator**.
    - Set up **alarms** to notify the engineering team when there’s a health check failure or increased latency, ensuring proactive intervention.
    - Use **CloudWatch Logs** for detailed logging to analyze and troubleshoot any failures or issues.

    ### **Benefits of This Solution:**

    1. **Reduced Latency**: By using **latency-based routing** with **Amazon Route 53** and **AWS Global Accelerator**, users are routed to the nearest AWS region, which reduces the time it takes to load the application.
    2. **Automatic Failover**: With **health checks** and **failover routing** (in both Route 53 and Global Accelerator), your application remains available even if one region or ELB fails.
    3. **Scalability and Reliability**: **Cross-Region ELB** and **Global Accelerator** ensure that your application can handle high-traffic demands globally, with improved **resilience** and **availability**.
    4. **Minimized Manual Intervention**: This solution automatically handles failover, reducing the need for manual intervention and preventing downtime.

    ### **Conclusion:**

    By implementing **Amazon Route 53**, **AWS Global Accelerator**, and **Cross-Region Elastic Load Balancers**, the company can achieve **low latency**, **automatic failover**, and **high availability** for its video streaming application. This solution ensures that the application remains performant and resilient to failures, without requiring manual intervention and significantly reducing the risk of service outages.
