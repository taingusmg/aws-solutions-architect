> A medium-sized business has a taxi dispatch application deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance. Because of an unknown bug, the application causes the instance to freeze regularly. Then, the instance has to be manually restarted via the AWS management console. What is the MOST cost-optimal and resource-efficient way to implement an automated solution until a permanent fix is delivered by the development team?

- The **most cost-optimal and resource-efficient** solution for automatically recovering the EC2 instance in the event of the application freezing is to use **AWS CloudWatch Alarms** combined with **EC2 Auto Recovery**.

    ### **Why This Solution?**

    1. **CloudWatch Alarms**: CloudWatch can monitor the **status checks** of your EC2 instance, specifically the **Instance Status Check**. If the instance becomes impaired due to a system issue, CloudWatch can trigger a recovery action.
    2. **EC2 Auto Recovery**: Amazon EC2 has an **Auto Recovery** feature that automatically recovers an instance when its status check fails, without the need for manual intervention. This is helpful when the instance freezes due to application issues, as it will automatically be restarted without requiring user action.

    ### **Steps to Implement the Solution:**

    ### **1. Create CloudWatch Alarm for EC2 Instance Status Check**

    - **CloudWatch Alarms** monitor metrics, and in this case, you'll monitor the EC2 instance's health by using the **InstanceStatusCheckFailed** metric.
    - If the **Instance Status Check** fails (for example, if the application causes the instance to freeze), the alarm will trigger an action.

    **Steps**:

    1. Open the **Amazon CloudWatch Console**.
    2. Select **Alarms** → **Create Alarm**.
    3. Choose the metric: Select **EC2** metrics → **Per-Instance Metrics** → **StatusCheckFailed (Instance)**.
    4. Set the threshold for the alarm to trigger if the status check fails for a specified duration (e.g., 1 minute).
    5. Set the alarm state to trigger if the status check fails.

    ### **2. Enable EC2 Auto Recovery**

    - Use **EC2 Auto Recovery** to recover the instance if the alarm triggers. Auto Recovery will restart the instance automatically when the instance status check fails, effectively addressing the application freeze issue.

    **Steps**:

    1. Go to the **EC2 Console**.
    2. Select your EC2 instance and choose **Actions** → **Instance Settings** → **Modify Auto Recovery**.
    3. Enable **Auto Recovery** and link it to the **CloudWatch Alarm** you just created.
    4. Select **Recover the instance** when a failure is detected.

    ### **3. Testing and Monitoring**

    - Test the solution by simulating an issue that would cause the instance to fail its status check (such as stopping an application process) to ensure that the instance automatically recovers.
    - Monitor the **CloudWatch** metrics and logs to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

    ### **Benefits of This Solution:**

    - **Cost-Effective**: This solution utilizes **existing AWS services** (CloudWatch and EC2 Auto Recovery) with minimal additional costs. There are no additional EC2 instances or resources required for this solution.
    - **Automatic Recovery**: It reduces manual intervention by automatically recovering the EC2 instance whenever it freezes, ensuring that the system is back up and running as quickly as possible.
    - **Simple Setup**: CloudWatch Alarms and EC2 Auto Recovery are straightforward to configure and integrate, making the solution easy to implement without adding complex components.
    - **Resource Efficient**: This solution doesn’t require additional infrastructure, such as a monitoring server or script-based solution, which keeps resources minimal.

    ### **Alternative Solutions**:

    - **Instance Health Checks with Lambda**: You could use **AWS Lambda** to run a custom script that monitors the instance and restarts it when necessary. However, using EC2 Auto Recovery combined with CloudWatch alarms is much simpler and more efficient in terms of setup and cost.
    - **Using AWS Systems Manager Automation**: AWS Systems Manager can also automate instance recovery, but this adds more complexity compared to using the built-in EC2 Auto Recovery feature.

    ### **Conclusion**:

    The **most cost-optimal and resource-efficient** solution for automating recovery of the EC2 instance is to use **CloudWatch Alarms** for monitoring the instance's health and **EC2 Auto Recovery** to restart the instance automatically when it freezes due to the application bug. This solution minimizes manual intervention, reduces downtime, and leverages existing AWS services without adding extra infrastructure costs.
